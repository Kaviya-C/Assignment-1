                     1.what is java?
                                  Ans: Java is widely used programming language.Because it supports Internet application,
                                          Mobile apps,system application.Java comes from primarily in C++.I need programming
                                          language that supports all os,compiler and that language must be efficient,safety and also
                                          extensibility(linux prog-->windows--->Mac)
                                                                 Founder:James Gosling 
                                                                 Time Period:1.5 years for first version ,1992
                                                                 Named :Oak
                                                                 Changed as: Java in 1995
                                          Java is a compiled and interpreted language open source,portability(windows-8--10--11),
                                          high security,

                     compiler--->translate into machine lang--->Intermediate lang(byte code(.class file))--->machine lang

                     [java development kit]compilation time--------------->.java program to .class file/shows syntax error

		        Compiler-->whole program translator
                                          Interpreter-->line by line execution
                                          portability--->same code works on multiple devices with different versions



                     2.Explain all the java features in one or two lines.
                              Ans:secured(not able to hack bcoz of java has 2 level of translation--->.java--->.class--->.exe),
                                     portable,robust,object-oriented, java is distributed (transfer the application/tcp/rmi)

                                     high performance,(one person written /compiled that class file used other user then user
                                     need not compile the application ,it is enough to use only the application in JRE)

                                     platform independent(write once run anywhere any time forever[WORA]
                                                             .class-->window/mac---JRE--game play))


                     3.In which folder can we find the javac,java,javah,javarmi commands?
                              Ans:Inside of  jdk --->bin folder---> we can see the javac,java,javah,java-rmi


                     4.what all the environment variables to set to run the java programs through command prompt?
                            Ans: step:1 download the jdk latest version
                                    step:2 create a sepearte folder to store my program
                                    step:3 find out the bin folder copy the path until the bin
                                              [example c:/program files/java/jdk17.0.1/bin]
                                    step:4 open cmd ,if another drive mean use cd to change the directory
                                            [c:/java_folder>set path=c:/program files/java/jdk17.0.1/bin] 
                                    press enter then type javac  then enter all the command/arguments of javac are displayed


                    5.what are the rules of naming the class
                          Ans: class name should be noun/descibe the things,first letter/character should be capitalized
                                   don't use keywords as class name
                                  Allowed characters, underscore(_),dollar$ ,digit 0to9.
                                  Avoid abbreviation/acronymns as a class name
                                  class name is an identifier it should not start with digits and it does not contain spaces
                                  java classname is unlimited(windows(260 characters),(unix(255)))
                   note: class name as same as file name without changing the lettercase(upper,lower)


                    6.which is the main entry point of java program
                         Ans: Entry point: java main() method----> public static void main(String[],args)
                                1. class-->collection of object/blueprint/template/college
                                2. method--->activity(classroom,lab,canteen,auditorium ,etc)
                                3. main---->important--->college should be reopened/gate opened
                                            [.java--->.class(jvm)--->starts main method]
                               
                                 * inside the class only main method present

                                 static---keyword /
                                 object-->combination of state and behaviour 
                                 class--->state and behaviour

                    when we use static keyword--whenever jdk saw the static then jdk understands as
                    static is one of the method in main it means this don't need object.it is class member/class behaviour
                    static members associated with class.it is common to all the objects
                    without object we can run the program bcoz of static keyword 
                                      
                  public---->access modifier/entire program /to call by jvm for run anywhere
                  static----->direct access wtihout object /we can accessing main method directly by using the static
                  void------>return to jvm only so i don't want to return anything for jvm so use void
                  main---->name of the function/iside jvm
                  String[],args--->command line arguments

                           * at runtime jvm unable to find the main method or mistakes in main() method
                              it throws NoSuchMethodError:main  
                                           we can also made some changes in : 
                                                 *static public 
                                                 *void main(String args[])/void main(String []args)
                                                 *instead of args we can take any valid java identifier examp(x,y,v)
                                                 *replace as String[] as main(String...args)
                                                 *final modifier/synchronized/strictfp in main method possible 

                    7.components of java program are?
                             Ans: module package,class definition,main method,variables, java statement


                    8.what is jvm,jre,jdk? 
                       Ans: JDK---->java development kit,it is platform independent(if error not present mean 
                               it just convert the[ .java prog to .class])(compiler/compilation time/platform independent)
                                (JRE+developer tool)  (JDK comes with JRE...)

                               JVM:java virtual machine,it is platform dependent,JIT compiler is one of the part/tool in Jvm
                               jvm decides what the platform is,it  may be 32 bit, 64 bit for that specification jvm will set the 
                               compiler so this is the role in jvm [.class file into binary language(0's,1's)]
                               jvm used to load the class files
 
                               JRE: java runtime environment , java virtual machine is in jre,it provides the runtime
                               environment for running the program[.exe file] (JVM+library classes)


                    9.Explain the components of compile time environments and run time environments.
                             Ans:  Compile time environment: JDK
                                      components inside JDK: jconsole,jar,jstack,etc
                                     
                                    Run Time Environment: JRE/JVM
                                    loading the code,verify the code,execute the code
                                    components inside the JRE: applet support classes ,java extension files, DLL files code libraries


                   10.what is JIT?
                         JIT:just in time compiler---> .class file converted into binary(0's,1's) for that purpose we use 
                         another compiler.This compiler converts each line by line as machine laguage(interpreter/platform
                         dependent(os+processor)  JIT inside of Java Virtual Machine
                         


                   11.different types of memory in jvm.
                            Ans:5 memory areas  in jvm
                            method area/static area:static variables/static methods/non-static method are stored/class files stored
                            heap area      :object creation/non-static variables are stored/objects stored
                            java stack area: execution happen in this area/local variables/intermediate operation stored
                            pc/program counter register:non-native methods/return address/native pointer
                            native method stack:


                   12.In which area .class is stored?
                           Ans:neither heap nor stack---->method area


                   13.In which area object are stored?
                             Ans:heap area


                   14.Why do we call as java simple?
                             Ans:java syntax is usually easier for new learner
 		  Easy to create and implement
                                     syntax based on c and c++


                   15.Why java is platform independent explain?
                             Ans:java is  platform independent(write once run anywhere any time forever[WORA]
                                                             .class-->window/mac---JRE--game play))

                   16.Is jvm platform dependent??
                          Ans:
	               jvm decides what the platform is,it  may be 32 bit, 64 bit for that specification jvm will set the 
                               compiler so this is the role in jvm

	             JVM:java virtual machine,it is platform dependent,JIT compiler is one of the part/tool in Jvm
                                 JIT:just in time compiler---> .class file converted into binary(0's,1's) for that purpose we use 
                         another compiler.This compiler converts each line by line as machine laguage(interpreter/platform
                         dependent(os+processor)  JIT inside of Java Virtual Machine

                   17.Is java case sensitive?
   	         Ans: yes  
                          example: count is not same as Count //car in class name is not same as Car


                   18.Is java complete object Oriented programming language?
                          Ans: No it is not purely object oriented programming language
  	         it also supports primitive data types:int bool long float char etc which are not objects
